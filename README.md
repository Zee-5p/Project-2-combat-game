## Features Left to Implement

### Multiplayer Mode
Future plans include adding a multiplayer mode where players can compete against each other in real-time. This expands the game's appeal by allowing friends to play together, increasing the game's replay value.

### Character Selection
Adding a roster of characters from the DBZ universe that can be selected by the user. Users will be able to select their favourite characters catering the game to them. This allows the game to be more customisable adding more variety and depth to the game.

### interchangeable packgrounds and theme music
Including chnageable packgrounds and theme music would give the game more of an arcade feel and once again give users more options enhancing the user experience.

### Enhanced animations and specific special attacks per character
In future versions the player animations when attacking would be improved and animations for attacks would be visible showing the energy being shot from one character at the other. Another feature that would be included would be giving each charcter their own special attack from the anime series and the corresponding animation. this improves the game mehcanics and the visual and gaming experience for the user.

### Adding levels of increasing difficulty 
As the users go through the game, if they were to win the first match then a new opponent would be loaded for 'level 2' this opponent would be stronger and have different attacks.
